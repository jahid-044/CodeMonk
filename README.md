# 🥋 CodeMonk

> An open-source AI-powered platform for understanding complex codebases.

Navigating a massive codebase shouldn't feel like wandering through an ancient maze without a map. CodeMonk is an open-source engineering initiative built to transform how developers discover, understand, and reason about complex, multi-service software systems. Instead of treating code as flat text files, CodeMonk builds structural knowledge graph representations and intelligent retrieval pipelines to bring deep architectural comprehension directly to developers.

## 💡 Why Does This Exist?

You clone a new repository on your first day. 

Or maybe you are tasked with adding a feature to a legacy monolith that your team inherited.

* **Thousands of files** across dozens of packages.
* **Hundreds of classes** deeply coupled through inheritance, interfaces, and dynamic dependency injection.
* **Multiple microservices** communicating asynchronously over message buses and RPCs.
* **Outdated documentation**—or worse, none at all.

You start grepping through the codebase. You jump from file to file following references. You open five different tabs of outdated Wiki pages. You ping senior engineers on Slack, waiting hours for a quick hint on how a single data pipeline flows. Before you write a single line of working code, you've spent days just trying to answer: *"Where does this request actually go?"*

CodeMonk is being built to eliminate this friction. We believe software architecture should explain itself, dynamically and accurately, powered by deep structural analysis and modern AI.

## 🎯 What Are We Building?

CodeMonk bridges raw code parsing with state-of-the-art AI reasoning. Rather than relying solely on naive keyword matching or plain vector embeddings of code snippets, CodeMonk extracts the underlying relationships—call graphs, data flows, cross-service contracts, and schema boundaries—into a unified context engine.

```
Repository
   ↓
Understand the Code (AST & Structural Parsing)
   ↓
Build Knowledge (Knowledge Graph & Vector Embeddings)
   ↓
Retrieve Context (Hybrid RAG & Relationship Traversal)
   ↓
Reason with AI (Spring AI & Multi-Agent Orchestration)
   ↓
Help the Developer (Instant Architectural Insights)
```

By connecting static code analysis with graph representations and large language models, CodeMonk allows developers to query their software system at an architectural level.

## 🔮 The Big Idea

Imagine opening your terminal or IDE and asking CodeMonk questions that previously required hours of code diving:

> 🗣️ **"How does user authentication work across services in this repository?"**
>
> 🗣️ **"Where does an incoming `/orders/checkout` request go after hitting the API gateway?"**
>
> 🗣️ **"What downstream services and message queues consume events published by `PaymentProcessedEvent`?"**
>
> 🗣️ **"If I change the signature of `UserService.updateProfile()`, what components might be affected?"**
>
> 🗣️ **"Explain this project's architecture to someone who has never seen it before."**

These are our core engineering goals. We are building the foundational pipelines to make this level of repository intelligence a reality.

## 🏗️ Architecture

CodeMonk is designed with a decoupled, event-driven architecture to process repositories at scale:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Ingestion ["1. Code Ingestion & AST Parsing"]
        Repo["Git Repository"] --> Parser["Tree-Sitter / Language Parsers"]
        Parser --> Extractor["Structural & Dependency Extractor"]
    end

    subgraph Processing ["2. Streaming & Knowledge Building"]
        Extractor --> Kafka["Apache Kafka Event Bus"]
        Kafka --> KG["Knowledge Graph (Neo4j / Graph DB)"]
        Kafka --> VectorStore["Vector Database (pgvector / Qdrant)"]
    end

    subgraph Intelligence ["3. Reasoning & AI Engine"]
        KG --> ContextEngine["Context Assembly Engine"]
        VectorStore --> ContextEngine
        ContextEngine --> SpringAI["Spring AI Agentic Framework"]
        SpringAI --> LLM["Code LLM / Local Fine-Tuned Model"]
    end

    subgraph Interface ["4. Developer Experience"]
        LLM --> API["REST & gRPC API Gateway"]
        API --> CLI["CodeMonk CLI / IDE Plugins / Web UI"]
    end
```

## 🚀 Quickstart for Local Development

Start the infrastructure containers and build the microservices ecosystem:

```bash
# 1. Start local infrastructure (PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, Kafka)
docker compose up -d

# 2. Build & run tests across all microservices
./mvnw clean test
```
